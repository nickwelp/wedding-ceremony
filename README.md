Saturday September 20th (2014) at 6pm - Creekside Driftwood

Rehearsal Friday 2:15pm 

STEVEN
Who presents this woman to be married to this man?

JAMES
Her mother and I do

STEVEN
Good evening, and welcome to this truly happy occasion. I want to thank you all for being here for this very special moment in the lives of Nick and Lynne.

We have come together today to acknowledge and strengthen a bond that already exists between Lynne and Nick, who are here to make public their love for each other. With the honorable assemblage of family and friends, they give notice of their commitment. They declare their choice to live, partner and grow together, out loud and in your presence. 

From their desire we will all come to feel a very real and intimate part of their decision, and thus make it more powerful. This is a great moment in their lives where we recognize and give meaning to the beauty of their love.

Nick and Lynne want to thank all of you who have travelled from near and far to witness this life changing moment. Your presence brings them great joy.

Let us pause to remember our loved ones who cannot be here today… Lynne and Nick especially honor their beloved grandparents. We recognize everyone’s ancestors, whose  struggles and accomplishments allow us all to be here. Nick and Lynne want to thank everyone who has touched their hearts and guided them into the present. 

Let us wish well for those struggling with sickness or injury, that they heal and will celebrate with us again.

Sand Ceremony
Lynne and Nick, today you are making a life-long commitment to share the rest of your lives with each other. Your relationship is symbolized through the pouring of these two individual containers of sand; one, representing you, Nick, all that you were, all that you are, and all that you will ever be, and the other representing you, Lynne, all that you were, all that you are, and all that you will ever be.

Each one holds its own unique beauty, strength, and character. They can stand on their own and be whole, without the need of anything else.  When the two are blended together they represent their extraordinary love.  Each grain of sand brings to the mixture a lasting beauty that forever enriches the combination.

[The Bride and Groom pick up the containers of sand]

As you each hold your sand the separate containers represent your lives to this moment; individual and unique.  As you now combine your sand, your lives also join together as one.

[The Bride and Groom blend the sand]
The life that each of you have experienced until now, individually, will hereafter be inseparably united, just as these grains of sand.

Holding of the Hands ceremony
William Shakespeare wrote “Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts.”  Please join your hands now.

These are the hands of your best friend. They are holding yours on your wedding day as you promise to love each other today, tomorrow and forever.

These are the hands that will work alongside yours as you build your future  together .

These are the hands that will love you and cherish you through the years, and whose touch will always comfort you.

These are the hands that will give you strength when you need it.

These are the hands that will always reach out with love, tenderness and respect.

These are the hands that will help you to hold your family as one.

These are the hands that will hold yours forever, reaching out to each other for all the forthcoming years, with the same tenderness behind this very touch.

May these hands continue to build a love that lasts a lifetime.


Nick and Lynne first met three years ago and knew quickly they’d have an enduring love for each other. Their puppy Blue foreshadowed what fate would transpire, with their oath now to share in their love and make a family together, forever.

Readings
[Juliane, Joel and Daniel gather to the groomsmen side for a reading, near MUSIC STAND and Mic]

JULIANE
This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible. And when it’s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be.
(Every Day by David Levithan)

JOEL
Love is a gift, from you, to each other. Some days it is difficult to give, but in giving, you learn the depth of your own love and character. Love is tested, but in affirming love over your trials, love is made profound.
(Enrich Fromm synopsis)

DANIEL
For the two of you, home isn’t a place. It is a person. And you are both finally home.
(Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins)

[After all three readings take your place back with the party]

Exchange of Truths ( the I do's and We do's)

STEVEN
Nick and Lynne, You have come here today to pledge your love to one another and exchange some of the most important promises of your lives. The symbolic declarations that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, "You know all those things we've promised and hoped and dreamed- well, I meant it all, every word." Look at one another and remember this moment in time.

Now you shall say a few words that take you across a threshold of life, and things will never quite be the same between you. For after these vows, you shall say to the world, “this is my husband, this is my wife.”

Do you both promise to cherish each other, love and comfort each other, to give each other security and strength?
LYNNE & NICK
We do.

STEVEN
Do you promise to plan your future together, live in the present together, and honor the past?

Exchange of Rings
STEVEN
In honor of these vows, Lynne and Nick will exchange rings as a token of their pledge and eternal love for each other. The wedding ring is a symbol of unity, and marks the beginning of a long journey filled with wonder, surprises, laughter, challenges, celebration, and joy. May these rings glow in reflection of the warmth and love, which flow through the wearers today.

May I have Nick's ring?  Lynne please repeat after me and place the ring on Nick’s finger.

STEVEN AND LYNNE [Call and Response]
I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. 
Whenever you look at it, may it remind you of the vows we make today. 
I take you to be my husband this day and every day.

I take you to be my wife this day and every day.

STEVEN
From this day forward these rings represent your most cherished love. 

Closing statement

Nick and Lynne have many shared experiences before them; the building of a home for themselves; certainly the chance to find out what true compromise is all about in daily living. They will have the opportunity to see that shared sorrows and challenges become less burdensome, and shared joys and triumphs can be more exhilarating. They will find love is in their hearts, and through their actions, love is brought into this world for them to share. 

Lynne and Nick, where you are now is a result of who you were, but where you end up depends entirely on who you choose to be from this moment forward. Let today be the day you give up who you’ve been for who you can become together.

Presentation of the Couple

In so much as the two of you have promised your love and devotion for each other,  today and every day hereafter. It is with great joy and the authority vested in me by the State of Texas, that I now pronounce you Husband and Wife.

Congratulations! You may kiss the bride!

Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time Mr. & Mrs. Welp!
