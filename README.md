STEVEN
Nick and Lynne, You have come here today to pledge your love to one another and exchange some of the most important promises of your lives. The symbolic declarations that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, "You know all those things we've promised and hoped and dreamed- well, I meant it all, every word." Look at one another and remember this moment in time.

Now you shall say a few words that take you across a threshold of life, and things will never quite be the same between you. For after these vows, you shall say to the world, “this is my husband, this is my wife.”

Do you both promise to cherish each other, love and comfort each other, to give each other security and strength?

We do.

I take you to be my wife this day and every day.

Closing statement

Nick and Lynne have many shared experiences before them; the building of a home for themselves; certainly the chance to find out what true compromise is all about in daily living. They will have the opportunity to see that shared sorrows and challenges become less burdensome, and shared joys and triumphs can be more exhilarating. They will find love is in their hearts, and through their actions, love is brought into this world for them to share. 

Lynne and Nick, where you are now is a result of who you were, but where you end up depends entirely on who you choose to be from this moment forward. Let today be the day you give up who you’ve been for who you can become together.

Presentation of the Couple

In so much as the two of you have promised your love and devotion for each other,  today and every day hereafter. It is with great joy and the authority vested in me by the State of Texas, that I now pronounce you Husband and Wife.

Congratulations! You may kiss the bride!

Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time Mr. & Mrs. Welp!
